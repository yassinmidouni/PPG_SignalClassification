# Implementation of a Blood Pressure Classification Model using PPG Signal based on Attention Mechanism
This repository contains the code and associated resources for our end-of-year project, undertaken as part of our computer engineering curriculum at the University of Tunis. Our project focuses on implementing an innovative classification model for blood pressure using PPG signal, leveraging attention mechanisms for more precise and efficient analysis.

#Project Objectives
Develop an algorithm for PPG signal processing to extract relevant features.
Design and train a classification model using machine learning techniques, integrating attention mechanisms to improve performance.
Test and evaluate the model on real datasets, comparing its performance to traditional methods.
